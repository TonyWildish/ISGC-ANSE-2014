\section{Integrating external sources of information}

\subsection{Sources of information}

Currently CERN runs three PhEDEx instances:

\begin{description}
	\item[Production] is used for production CMS data transfers
	\item[Debug] is used for link monitoring and link commissioning tests
	\item[Development] is used for testing software and DB schema upgrades
\end{description}

Although the instances run on the same infrastructure, each one is independent 
of the rest. The Production instance choses transfer sources based on its 
internal monitoring data alone. The Debug instance on the other hand,
has monitoring information about many more links. Because of this, it makes
sense that where links are shared, network statistics should be shared
as well (Figure \ref{fig:Prod-vs-Debug})

  data}

\end{figure} 

A tool has been developed which retrieves statistics from all instances and 
aggregates the data. This tool then produces a file that the FileRouter agent
can use.

The next step is to integrate it with perfSONAR, effectively gaining a 
more comprehensive picture of what's happening on the network. At the time of
writing this paper, perfSONAR is yet to be deployed on all sites. We also
lack a perfSONAR API which we can call to retrieve this data.
