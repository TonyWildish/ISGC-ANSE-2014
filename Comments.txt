General comments:
- some figures should potentially be moved so they're closer to the text which is referencing them

Section 3
- perhaps we need to have a more in depth explanation concerning the prototype

Section 4
- before explaining how the FDT integration works, perhaps it would be interesting to
explain how the FileDownload agent manages transfers. This is already explained in 
Section 5, so perhaps we could move it to a new section/subsection 

Section 5

1) Should there be a table of contents, as there is now? That's not normal, I think. If it doesn't come from the template, better remove it before submission. That said, I like it now, it helps me see the structure easily!

2) acronyms: the general rule is that you define acronyms at the point you first use them, inline with the text, and not in a footnote. Also, don't bother to define the acronym unless you use it again later, or it's a name of something you're citing a reference for. Otherwise you're just making the reader learn a new acronym for nothing.

5) need to make sure all references appear sequentially numbered, i.e. in the right order in bibliography.tex

6) You should check with Harvey/Artur about acknowdging the funding source. You may be required to do that!
