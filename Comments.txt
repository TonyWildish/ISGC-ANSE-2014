General comments:
- some figures should potentially be moved so they're closer to the text which is referencing them

Section 2

- first bullet point item is duplicated with intro. 
- "used a storage node" -> "used as a storage node"

Section 3
- perhaps we need to have a more in depth explanation concerning the prototype

Section 4
- first page: some footnotes should potentially be citations
- before explaining how the FDT integration works, perhaps it would be interesting to
explain how the FileDownload agent manages transfers. This is already explained in 
Section 5, so perhaps we could move it to a new section/subsection 

Section 5
- "before marking task as" -> "before marking the task as"
- "is the task as marked ready" -> "is the task marked ready"
- "eventually starts the files" -> "eventually starts, the files"
- "PhEDEX will just try" -> "PhEDEX will just retry"
- check_circuit_setup: folders should be in '' or italics
- move last 2 figures before references
