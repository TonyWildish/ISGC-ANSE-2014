\section{Summary and future plans}

PhEDEx is an important part of the software stack of the CMS collaboration and
because of this, it is essential that it evolves and adapts new technologies 
where possible. 

Over the course of the past year, the ANSE project has made significant progress
towards integrating network-awareness into PhEDEx. In our latest work we have
created and tested a prototype which integrates the use of virtual-circuits into
PhEDEx. This is done transparently for the other site-agents, with no modifications
done to the database schema and with all the logic contained in the FileDownload
agent.

Our immediate goal is to adopt a circuit management system and use its API to
control and operate real circuits. This will be followed by extensive tests, on 
a potentially expanded ANSE testbed.

Once this system is working as expected, we will proceed to integrate the use
of virtual circuits at the FileRouter level. Here, we gain a global view of 
CMS-wide flows, which means we can make informed (optimal) decisions about which 
circuits need to be requested or not.
