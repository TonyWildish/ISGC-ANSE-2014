\abstract{
PhEDEx is the data placement and management tool in CMS, which controls bulk 
data-flows. While robust, its architecture is now ten years old and has yet to fully 
adapt to today's production environment, an environment in which the network is 
the fastest and most reliable component.

The ANSE (Advanced Network Services for Experiments) project, in the context of 
CMS, aims to greatly improve PhEDEx' network awareness for smart source 
selection, as well as to integrate bandwidth provisioning capabilities in the data 
transfer management. Both parts require a good knowledge of the network status, 
topology and of course, access to useful and up-to-date performance metrics.

One of the first steps towards this goal involved the identification of a mechanism 
for informing PhEDEx about independent network performance metrics. Methods 
for providing these metrics have been prototyped and verified in a LAN testbed 
using fake data transfer requests. This mechanism is already directly usable by CMS 
in their production environment.

Currently, the ANSE-PhEDEx testbed is spread over many servers at a number of 
sites. It is composed of several machines dedicated to PhEDEx site agents, one 
server holding the PhEDEx central agents, a central database and one server which 
contains the PhEDEx website and data-service. Some of the site nodes have 
additional attached storage nodes.

In this paper, we present the results of PhEDEx data transfers using the Fast Data 
Transfer (FDT) tool, on high-speed WAN circuits ranging from a few Gbps up to 40
 Gbps. We continue by discussing their implications for intelligently controlling the 
network from within PhEDEx. This involves development within PhEDEx itself, 
integration between PhEDEx and various network fabric tools, and possibly 
requirements for development of the fabric tools themselves, to support more
 sophisticated PhEDEx use-cases.

Finally, the paper will also describe the future plans for the project.}
